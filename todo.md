# To Do
- Fix `if (wasm === undefined)`
- Remove empty `pkg` folder (generated by `wasm-pack-plugin`?)
- Remove empty `dist/html.js` file (generated by `config_html` in webpack config)
- Remove empty `dist/style.js` file (generated by `config_css` in webpack config)
- Why doesn't `tsconfig`'s `exclude` work?

x Find how `1.bundle.js` is generated
x Understand webpackBootstrap
